# Project Overview

Modern semiconductor engineering teams work with large volumes of heterogeneous data, including process documentation, yield reports, failure analysis notes, and support tickets. Extracting actionable insights from these sources is time-consuming and often requires deep domain expertise.

This project builds an LLM-powered assistant designed to support semiconductor engineers and analysts by enabling natural language queries over domain-specific data and documentation.

The primary users are semiconductor process engineers, yield analysts, and data engineers seeking faster insight into manufacturing trends and anomalies.

The assistant is designed to answer questions related to yield trends, recurring failure modes, process deviations, historical context from internal documentation, and summarized insights from engineering notes or tickets.

The system emphasizes traceability by returning answers grounded in retrieved source documents with explicit citations.

This project does not aim to replace engineering judgment, perform automated process control, or make real-time manufacturing decisions.

The scope is limited to analytics, summarization, and decision support rather than autonomous action.
